-     Shield

-     Asteroids

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the game is to protect the SPACESHIP from impacting ASTEROIDS by controlling 
the SHIELD. 

The player starts with 100 health points and needs to prevent ASTEROIDS from  hitting or crossing the 
SPACESHIP boundary. THe player will be able to summon a AID SHIP and SPACE ANIMAL to help the user 
destroy the asteroids. There are three tpyes of ASTEROID:

1. BLUE ASTEROID  : -1 HEALTH POINT

2. GREEN ASTEROID : -3 HEALTH POINT

3. RED ASTEROID   : -9 HEALTH POINT

Starting with the SHIELD, the players controls the direction and position of the SHIELD with the mouse. 
A life counter will indicate the current playing status, when the player reaches 0 live, they lose, every 50 ASTEROIDS they 
destroy, makes the overall velocity of the ASTEROIDS increase by 1 (v = +1). The ASTEROIDS bounce when they hit the 
limits of the  window, meaning the user must acount for changes in the direction (vectorial trajection changes) of the asteroid. 

GEMS   : Gives more SPACE ANIMAL summonings. 

ENERGY : Gives the user + 10 Health points.
